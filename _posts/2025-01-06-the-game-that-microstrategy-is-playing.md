## 21/21 Plan

According to the [news](https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2024/10/31/microstrategy-announces-42-billion-bitcoin-investment-plan/) in October 2024, MicroStrategy raised $2.1 billion in Q3 2024 to expand its bitcoin holdings in two ways:

1) $1.1 billion by selling 8 million Class A common stock shares (regular company shares)

2) $1.0 billion through Convertible Senior Notes - bonds that can be converted into company shares at $183.19 per share by 2028

The new raised fund helped the company to pay off the more expensive loan, which was paid at 6.125% interest rate. Also, with paying off the loan which required Bitcoin as the collateral, all the bitcoin holdings in MSTR is free from any loan obligation.

Also, MSTR outlined the direction of raising $21 billion through equity financing and another $21 billion through fixed-income securities. The capital raise schedule is planned as below.

|Year|Total Amount|Equity|Debt|
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|2025|$10 billion|$5 billion|$5 billion|
|2026|$14 billion|$7 billion|$7 billion|
|2027|$18 billion|$9 billion|$9 billion|

Assume that the average execution price is $100,000, which was the price milestone that BTC achieved in 2024. A total of $42 billion can purchase 420,000 bitcoins, while the current holdings in MSTR is 444,262 bitcoins as of 26th December, 2024. It means that their strategy to double their BTC holdings in the coming 3 years is actually not too adventurous but rather conservative, if you compare with their history of doubling their holdings from 200k to 400k bitcoins in a year.

## BTC Yield

The "BTC Yield" is the KPI of MSTR strategy in the BTC purchase plan. Basically, MSTR uses the BTC Yield to help assess the pace to acquire BTC on the basis of each outstanding share. To be precise, it measures the "percentage change period-to-period of the ratio between the Company’s bitcoin holdings and its Assumed Diluted Shares Outstanding.". The diluted shares are mainly contributed by the recently issued convertible bonds. So, the bottom line is that MSTR targets to achieve an increasing BTC holdings per unit of share even though all the issued convertibles are converted into equities.

For example, on 30th December, 2024, MSTR acquired 2.1k BTC and [achieved](https://www.microstrategy.com/press/microstrategy-acquires-2138-btc-achieves-btc-yield-of-47-qtd-74-ytd-now-holds-446400-btc_12-30-2024) a BTC yield of 47.8% QTD and 74.1% YTD. It is interesting to see that MSTR frequently announces the BTC acquisition in the SEC 8-k form. The purpose of the 8-k form is for the listed companies to announce the material events and significant corporate changes, e.g. mergers and acquisitions, that may affect investors' and shareholders' decisions. MSTR has announced Bitcoin purchases for eight consecutive weeks and they are all announced in both company news and 8-k forms. This helps MSTR mitigate any potential risk from SEC scrutiny, and gives a great transparency for investors about its current BTC positions.

## NAV premium 

All these sound like an appealing story, but the caveat is now the NAV premium is still at a high level. NAV premium is calculated as the ratio of the MSTR market cap to their total BTC holding value. Thanks for the website [MSTR Tracker] - it has an amazing graph to illustrate the current MSTR NAV premium and its trend. 

The graph below shows that

1. The latest NAV premium in the red horizontal line - 1.74x as of 31st December, 2024
2. The green line suggests the NAV premium is positively correlated to the BTC prices - the higher the BTC price surges, the greater the NAV premium traded on the MSTR stock prices 
3. The color of the data points indicates the time of the NAV premium. As of 31st December, the red and orange points represent the November and December premiums, when MSTR has acquired nearly 40% of its BTC holdings in just 2 months. These data points indicate the surge of the NAV premiums to the average level of 2x.

Even though MSTR's KPI is to keep an increasing BTC holdings per share, the investors joining the party late pay 1.74x premium on the MSTR stock price, regarding to their actual BTC assets in the book. The question is - if the investors are well informed, why do they still join the party to pay such an expensive premium, rather than purchasing the Bitcoin ETFs?

## Convertible Bonds

The 21/21 plan is to raise the fund from both the equity and debt market to accumulate the BTC holdings. What amazes the practitioners is the financial engineering part in issuing the convertible bonds to raise the significant amount of capital for BTC acquisition. As mentioned before, MSTR called the expensive debt paying 6.125% interest rate in October 2024, and then [issued](https://www.microstrategy.com/press/microstrategy-announces-pricing-of-convertible-senior-notes-11-20-2024) the new convertible bond at 0% interest rate in November. The new convertible bond is unsecured, senior obligations, and will mature in December 2029. The market reacted well after the announcement that the stock price jumped around 7% right after. The table below lists all the active MSTR convertible bonds. The (notional weighted) average of the interest rates is 0.48%, which is an absolutely low borrowing cost for MSTR.

| Principal Amount (M) | Interest Rate | Issue Date | Maturity Date | Strike | 
|-----------------------|---------------|------------|---------------|---------|
| $1,050 | 0.000% | Feb-21 | Feb-27 | $143.2 | 
| $800 | 0.625% | Mar-24 | Mar-30 | $149.8 | 
| $600 | 0.875% | Mar-24 | Mar-31 | $232.7 | 
| $800 | 2.250% | Jun-24 | Jun-32 | $204.3 | 
| $1,000 | 0.625% | Sep-24 | Sep-28 | $183.2 | 
| $3,000 | 0.000% | Nov-24 | Dec-29 | $672.4 |

A blog [post](https://blog.bitmex.com/microstrategy-bonds-can-mstr-get-liquidated/) from BitMEX research team has well explained the conditions and scenarios of the convertibility in the convertible bonds. Take the September 2024 issued bond as an example. The convertible bond has the following features

1. **Convertible**: The bond holders have the right to convert the bond to class A shares, either in the initial period (3.5 years) if the bond prices are traded at a significant discount in the market, or after the initial period
2. **Put**: The bond holders can demand MSTR to redeem the bond in cash after 3 years
3. **Call**: MSTR can redeem the bond after 3 years and 3 months

This means MSTR structured the bond to capture various trading environment to compensate the low interest rate for the investors

1. **Convertible**: If the bond prices trade below the implied conversion value, the holders can immediately convert the bond to the stocks
2. **Put**: When the MSTR (and likely BTC as well) does not perform, the holders can redeem the bond to cash.
3. **Call**: When the MSTR price is very strong (30% over conversion price = 30% over 40% premium over the reference stock price = 82% over the reference stock price)

But it doesn't seem that these features are for the directional bets of MSTR and BTC prices, does it?

## Convertible Arbitrage Game

Convertible arbitrage is still one of the common strategies among institutional investors. With MSTR convertible bonds, the execution strategy can be like the following

1. Going long on MSTR convertible bonds
2. Simultaneously shorting MSTR stock to achieve delta neutrality

For example, the Sep 2028 matured bond was issued with a 40% premium over the reference stock price and a conversion rate of 5.4589 class A share per $1000 principal amount. Approximately, 0.5 delta exposure of the MSTR convertible bond is hedged by shorting the half amount worth of its notional value in the stock / futures market. Before the period when the bondholders have the rights to exercise the conversion option, the strategy longs and shorts more shares to maintain the dollar neutral. Sometimes, the derivative instruments, e.g. futures and options, are employed to reduce the transaction and borrowing cost. 

Once the whole position is maintained in dollar neutrality, the positive gamma provides the profitability from the large stock movement. The [news](https://www.ft.com/content/a6d9e3f1-4576-45fb-b16b-0767fe103039) released by FT in mid December has outlined the great "financial engineering" feature of the MSTR convertible bonds.

> “It’s some incredible financial engineering,” said a convertible bond portfolio manager invested in MicroStrategy. “[Saylor has] created this incredible situation where a stock trades at three times the price of the underlying bitcoin and then he just sells more shares every day and buys more bitcoin.”

Also, a video [released](https://youtu.be/j_6URnhtQ2U?si=6EeFXY4_Xqh7Dk57) by [Mark Meldrum](https://www.markmeldrum.com/) in mid November, who provides services of CFA and FRM studying materials and illustrated MSTR as an example of the convertible bonds, has explained so well about the gamma game that Michael Saylor is introducing. It gave a great insight that actually Michael knew well what MSTR business model and convertible bonds are selling to the share and bond holders, while the institutional investors also understood well the game that Michael was creating in the market. Just the retail investors placing the directional bets in MSTR and BTC may not understand thoroughly.

> You won't understand the game that's being played. You're thinking that you're playing basketball but you're playing basketball on a soccer field. So, every time you pick up the ball, the whistle blows. You get a penalty and you can't understand why. Because that's what you're supposed to do in basketball, but again you're playing the wrong game.

There are also a few more coverages like the Bloomberg [news](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-12-05/convertible-bond-arbs-are-making-microstrategy-wall-street-s-hottest-trade) and reddit [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1h4yn3z/truth_behind_the_mstr_convertible_bond_arbitrage/). A reddit [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1h4yn3z/comment/m02sv4g/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) summarized the full picture well 

>  To put it in plain English what he is explaining is MSTR is selling volatility to its bond holders.

So, MSTR knows exactly what they are selling, and the holders are mostly clear about the game they are in.

## Who's in?

Looking further into the holders, I am intrigued to find out how they executed the strategy. As most of them are hedge funds, the filings required by SEC are only the aggregated firm level. The 13-F form covers the net holdings of all the strategies and pods within the same firm, while the firm may have tens or even hundreds of strategies and pods across various strategies. For example, a long-short equity strategy team may hold a long position in the MSTR stock, and the convertible arbitrage strategy team may short a similar size of position in the MSTR stock for the delta hedge. Their net MSTR position is only shown in the 13-F form.

According to the filings, the major bond holders include Allianz and State Street, but some of these holders are in the long position in the bond and positive delta exposure. Looking further into a few participants, I am intrigued to see that a few of them, like Point72, may have positioned correctly in the game.

### Point72

First, we can look into Point72 Asset Management, one of the largest multi-strategy hedge funds founded by Steven Cohen. Their 2024 Q3 [filing](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1603466/000090266424006620/xslForm13F_X02/infotable.xml) shows the following holdings in MSTR. The first two rows are the MSTR call and put option respectively, and the final row is the MSTR [convertible bond](https://public.com/bonds/corporate/microstrategy-inc/mstr-0.0-02-15-2027-594972ae1?wpsrc=Organic+Search&wpsn=www.google.com) maturing in February 2027. 
​​ 

| NAME OF ISSUER       | TITLE OF CLASS | CUSIP      | VALUE       | SHRS / PRN AMT | SH / PRN | CALL / PUT |
|-----------------------|----------------|------------|-------------|----------------|----------|------------|
| MICROSTRATEGY INC    | CL A NEW       | 594972408  | 6,305,640   | 37,400         | SH       | Call       |
| MICROSTRATEGY INC    | CL A NEW       | 594972408  | 20,906,400  | 124,000        | SH       | Put        |
| MICROSTRATEGY INC    | NOTE 2/1       | 594972AE1  | 3,419,474   | 2,500,000      | PRN      |            |


Though the filing only states the aggregated positions in the pull options without specifying their strikes and maturity, it is reasonable to derive that the put options, instead of shorting the stocks, were employed for delta hedging, and possibly for convertible bond arbitrage specifically. The benefits of using put options over shorting the stocks are the capital efficiency and sometimes a lower borrowing cost. So, Point72 may have already joined the game early.

### Millennium management

According to Millennium's official [website](https://www.mlp.com/), there are 320+ investment teams, which probably represents the pods. As Millennium has a broader range of strategies and trading methodologies (from medium term to intraday reallocation), it's much harder to break down the 13-F holdings into the corresponding strategies, especially if Millennium may have deployed multiple equity and fixed income strategies. From the [latest](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1273087/000127308724000118/xslForm13F_X02/MLP_Filing_20240930.xml) 13-F filing, as of 2024 Q3, similar to Point72, they held the MSTR convertible bond and the put options. Their convertible position (over $100M notional) is much bigger than the Point72 one. Perhaps multiple pods are in the game.

### BlackRock

In the meanwhile, one of the top performing fixed income funds in BlackRock may have joined the game as well. [Strategic Income Opportunities Fund](https://www.blackrock.com/us/individual/products/227660/blackrock-strategic-income-opportunitiesinst-cl-fund), with $40B AUM managed by Rick Rieder, has coverage over the global fixed income and derivative market, and has been performing so well and consistently. In the [document](https://www.blackrock.com/us/individual/literature/third-quarter-report/tqr-retail-blackrock-strategic-income-opportunities-portfolio.pdf) about their Q3 2024 portfolio, it shows that they held around $16M notional value of MSTR convertible bonds (matured in 2028 and 2032) and shorted 38k shares of MSTR stock. Though, compared with their AUM and all other holdings, their exposure is relatively small, it will be interesting to see whether they have purchased the Nov 2024 issued bond in the upcoming Q4 2024 report.

### AQR

[AQR Diversified Arbitrage Fund](https://funds.aqr.com/funds/aqr-diversified-arbitrage-fund#about) is one of the institutional investors holding the Sep 2028 matured bond. From the recent Q3 holding [document](https://connect.rightprospectus.com/AQRFunds/TVT/00203H602/QH3?site=Funds&isProofing=true), as of Q3 2024, the fund held the positions of

1. Long 15.75M notional of Sep 2028 MSTR convertible bond
2. Short 172.4K shares of MSTR stock worth of $29M 

Since the Sep 2028 bond was issued, the stock price ($168.60 as of Sep 2024) is near to the conversion price ($183.19) in early October. Even though now the bond is already in the money, the firm oversold the stocks and actually attained a significant negative delta position. It is not straightforward to get through the negative delta, while there are two possible reasons behind it - one is the conviction in the shortfall in the stock price upward momentum, while another is the manager might have foreseen another round of the bond issue and purchase. With the upcoming Q4 2024 report, we may get a better picture of their total position.

## Conclusion

The market always moves faster than I anticipate. When I was writing about this story, there were a few more stories about MSTR unfolding every day. It became much more difficult to append layers and layers of new information and redo the research in the new materials. In the meanwhile, I am glad to see that crowdsourcing, like [saylortracker.com](https://saylortracker.com/) and [mstr-tracker](https://mstr-tracker.com/), is actually playing a critical role in unfolding Michael Saylor's magic in the market. Though most of them are actually the ethanists supporting the crypto market and MSTR strategy, the transparent information helps others to get through the game that Michael is purposing - either astonishing the creativity behind the financial engineering, or dismaying the inaccurate information spread through the hype.
