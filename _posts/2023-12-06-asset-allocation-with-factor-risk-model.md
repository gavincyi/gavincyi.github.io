## Background

It was a perplexing puzzle to me when I first read Giuseppe A. Paleologo's book "Advanced Portfolio Management" in 2022. The book (in Chapter 6) introduces the concept of alpha sizing, a technique for allocating positions based on expected returns of alphas and risk. After an in-depth empirical analysis of various sizing rules, the author provides a concise insight:

> Proportional sizing method beats other common methods, e.g. mean-variance portfolio

In the realm of quantitative finance, I was taught that the Mean-Variance (MV) portfolio, also known as the Markowitz portfolio, is considered the standard, the golden rule, and the best approach for asset allocation, especially when considering target portfolio risk. Given this, I couldn't help but wonder: if mean-variance isn't the optimal approach for alpha generation, why do we invest so much effort and resources in its development? I've been patiently awaiting an opportunity to explore this question further.
