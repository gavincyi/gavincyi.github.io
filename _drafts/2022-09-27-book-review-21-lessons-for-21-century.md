"Does the future look more pessimistic?"

In general, I am cautious in choosing the books which forecast the future. I avoid myself spending too much time reading these books. Not only most of the time the forecasts described in the books are barely correct and eventually turn into jokes, but also they often direct to a gloomy future. If these books described a better and optimistic future, what would be the incentives to read them?
