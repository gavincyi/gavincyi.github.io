It was a great time in PyCon Ireland 2023, though the time was too short due to chores during weekend. 
My first time there was in 2019 and it was hosted in the same venue, Radisson Blu. I was glad to see
both the familar and new faces in the conference.

## Same old

The conference is hosted in a 2-day length, and most of the time, two speaker and workshop sessions 
were run in parallel. The topics still covers the following technical areas

- Core Python
- Webservice
- Machine Learning
- Data Analysis



The organiser fought hard to strike the balance across various backgrounds of attendees, so other 
topics are included. For example, one of the keynote talks is 
"Child Prodigies and 6 Figure Salaries? Discussing Realist Methods and Goals in Python Education",
of which the 6 figure salary is the highlight of the day.

Pizza night is still remained on the first conference day for attendees to network, while it seems
that the pub quiz night was too exhausting either for the origaniser to host, or the attendees to 
ponder after a long day with beers, so I can avoid the faux pas moment of being brainteased.


## Observations in PyCon Ireland 2023

1. Still Machine Learning, but inclined to LLM

Machine Learning is still a hot darling for most PyCon events, while, thanks for OpenAI and ChatGPT,
NLP and LLM dominated them. Apart from talks, NLP workshop was pretty full as well. I have to admit
I am one of those rushing to the new gold mine.
