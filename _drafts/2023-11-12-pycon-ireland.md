Yes, I fled to Dublin again after my previous week of Dublin Marathon. I ain't sure why I am so stuck
in Dublin, but it's true that it's my forth time to this city. This time I went there for PyCon
Ireland 2023.

It was a great time there though the time was too short due to chores during weekend. 
My first time there was in 2019 and it was hosted in the same venue, Radisson Blu. I was glad to see
both the ~~old~~ familar and new faces in the conference.

## Same old

It is hosted in a 2-day length, and most of the time, two speaker and workshop sessions 
were run in parallel. The topics still covers the following technical areas

- Core Python
- Webservice
- Machine Learning
- Data Analysis

The organiser fought hard to strike the balance across various backgrounds of attendees, so a diversed 
range of topics are included. For example, one of the keynote talks is 
"Child Prodigies and 6 Figure Salaries? Discussing Realist Methods and Goals in Python Education",
of which the 6 figure salary is the highlight of the day.

Pizza night is still remained on the first conference day for attendees to network, while it seems
that the pub quiz night was too exhausting either for the origaniser to host, or the attendees to 
ponder after a long day with beers. At lease, I can avoid the faux pas moment of being brainteased.


## Observations in PyCon Ireland 2023

1. Still Machine Learning, but inclined to LLM

Machine Learning is still a hot darling for most PyCon events, while, thanks for OpenAI and ChatGPT,
NLP and LLM dominated them. Apart from talks, NLP workshop was pretty full as well. I have to admit
I am one of those rushing to the new gold mine.

2. Multinational

In one of the reports in 2020, it showed Dublin ranked the top European Headquarter locations per capita.
Therefore, I wasn't surprised to often come across with engineers from FAANG or other multinational corps.
Though it is declared that Ireland is no longer a tax heaven under the new [BEPS 2.0](https://www.ey.com/en_uk/tax/base-erosion-profit-shifting-beps),
an English speaking capital still attracts a diversified background of engineers.

3. Not Solely Software

An interesting phenomenon is a few talks and workshops are around Python in cloud service and 
Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC). When I talked with a few attendees, I heard one of the Python use cases
is Python scripts in AWS Lambda. Also, some of them reflected that now they took up more responsibilities
in cloud deployment and infrastructure than before. It aligns with my understanding that the trend
in software engineering is - software is no longer the plat in the menu. The term "application" is replaced
by "service", which means a full stack in the right infrastructure. But, why still AWS? To be fair, where
are GCP and MS Azure?

4. No more PowerPoints

Honestly, I hate M*******t's products, so I am so glad that I didn't see anyone using PowerPoints in the presentation
materials. Now, the speakers adapt better alternative to PowerPoints. We all know that these alternatives are
more powerful and charming than the dull and tedious PPTX. I used a product derived from [RemarkJS](https://github.com/gnab/remark)
and it still works so well in both presentation and editing. So, please, don't use PPTX anymore, as long as it
is free for Google Slides.
