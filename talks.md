## [Why should you learn writing C extension?](https://tw.pycon.org/2020/en-us/conference/talk/1159574667502027113/)

### PyCon Taiwan 2020

In the talk, I would like to give out the solutions to these myths by introducing modern approaches on writing C extension. Also I will try to convince the audience that, with the appropriate tools, migrating the pure Python code to C extension code in the performance critical components can be a great investment in the application.
